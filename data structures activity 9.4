9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt 
and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and 
takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address
to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary 
is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find 
the most prolific committer.
